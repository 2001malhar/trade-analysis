# Trading Results Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing trading results using a Jupyter Notebook. It includes various statistical and visual analyses of trading performance, such as drawdown, profit distribution, and probability of loss.

## Contents
- `Trading Results Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the trading results analysis.
- `Trading Results Analysis.pdf` - PDF version of the analysis report.
- `img/` - Contains various images used in the analysis, including:
  - `drawdown.png`
  - `probability_of_loss.png`
  - `profit_histogram.png`
- `.git/` - Git repository metadata.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn
  ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Trading Results Analysis.ipynb"
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. Review the generated visualizations and insights.

## Visualizations
The project includes multiple statistical graphs:
- **Drawdown Analysis**: Evaluates the maximum loss from a peak to a trough before a new peak is attained.
- **Profit Distribution Histogram**: Analyzes how profits are distributed over time.
- **Probability of Loss**: Determines the likelihood of encountering a loss based on historical data.
